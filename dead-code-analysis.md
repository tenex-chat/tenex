# Dead Code Analysis Report

## Summary
After deep analysis of the TypeScript codebase, the following dead code was identified. All findings have been verified to avoid false positives.

## 1. Unused Imports (7 files affected)

### src/agents/execution/ToolStreamHandler.ts:3
- `ConversationIntent` is imported but never used

### src/llm/providers/MockProvider.ts:5
- `Message` is imported but never used

### src/services/status/StatusPublisher.ts:8,13
- `getNDK` is imported but never used
- `NDKEvent` is imported but never used

### src/tenex.ts:4
- `logError` is imported but never used

### src/tools/implementations/agents-list.ts:3
- `getProjectContext` is imported but never used

### src/tools/implementations/agents-read.ts:2
- `getProjectContext` is imported but never used

### src/utils/inventory.ts:4
- `getNDK` is imported but never used

## 2. Unused Variables and Parameters

### src/llm/providers/MockProvider.ts:212
- Parameter `request` is declared but never used

### src/llm/providers/MockProvider.ts:213
- Variable `ndk` is declared but never used

### src/tools/implementations/agents-read.ts:103
- Variable `registryEntry` is declared but never used

### src/tools/implementations/agents-write.ts:65
- Variable `projectContext` is declared but never used

## 3. Stale Comments Referencing Deleted Code

### src/utils/inventory.ts:74,92
- Comments reference `TaskPublisher` which has been deleted
- Lines 74 and 92: "// Progress tracking handled by TaskPublisher"

### src/utils/inventory.ts:56,87,101
- TODO comments reference `AgentPublisher` replacements that appear stale
- Line 56: "// TODO: Replace with AgentPublisher task creation"
- Line 87: "// TODO: Re-enable progress updates with AgentPublisher"
- Line 101: "// TODO: Re-enable completion updates with AgentPublisher"

## 4. Type Issues That May Indicate Dead/Incorrect Code

### src/llm/models.ts:32,39
- Using `baseUrl` instead of correct `baseURL` property

### src/llm/providers/MockProvider.ts:103-109
- Accessing properties that don't exist on the union type (delay, error)

### src/services/status/StatusPublisher.ts:101
- Using `llm` property that doesn't exist on `AgentInstance` type

### src/llm/providers/MockProvider.ts:166
### src/llm/providers/SimpleMockProvider.ts:82
- Using `total_tokens` property that doesn't exist on `LlmUsage` type

## 5. Recently Deleted Files (Git Status)
These files were deleted recently and no longer exist:
- src/claude/DelayedMessageBuffer.ts
- src/event-handler/__tests__/task.test.ts
- src/event-handler/task.ts
- src/nostr/TaskPublisher.ts
- src/nostr/__tests__/TaskPublisher.test.ts

## 6. Potential Issues

### src/claude/orchestrator.ts:82
- Type error: string | undefined assigned to string (potential null check missing)

### src/llm/router.ts:451,462
- Variable `scenarios` has implicit any[] type

### src/services/status/StatusPublisher.ts:235
- Accessing `getExecutionQueueState` on an empty object

## Recommendations

1. **Remove all unused imports** - These are safe to delete immediately
2. **Remove or use unused variables** - Either delete them or prefix with underscore if intentionally unused
3. **Clean up stale comments** - Remove references to deleted TaskPublisher and outdated TODOs
4. **Fix type issues** - Correct the property names and add proper type definitions
5. **Address TypeScript errors** - Run `npm run typecheck` and fix all reported issues

## Impact Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Most dead code consists of unused imports and variables
- **Medium Risk**: Type errors should be fixed to prevent runtime issues
- **No Functional Impact**: Removing these will not affect functionality

## Verification
To verify these findings:
1. Run `npm run typecheck` to see TypeScript errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to catch additional issues
3. Build the project to ensure no compilation errors after cleanup
