# NEW-FLOW Implementation Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current implementation of the NEW-FLOW architecture against its specification. The analysis reveals several critical inconsistencies between the documented plan and actual implementation, as well as dead code from the old orchestrator system.

## Critical Findings

### 1. NDKTask Implementation Incomplete ‚ùå

**Specification (NEW-FLOW.md lines 104-203):**
- Delegation should create formal NDKTask events (kind 1934)
- Each recipient gets a unique NDKTask with p-tag assignment
- Tasks link to conversation root via e-tag
- System tracks completion via task IDs

**Actual Implementation:**
- `delegate.ts` creates NDKTask events but **defers publishing** (lines 169-172)
- Events are signed but stored as serialized data for later publishing
- The deferred publishing happens in `ReasonActLoop.ts` after LLM metadata is available (lines 389-504)
- This creates a timing issue where tasks aren't immediately visible to other agents

**Impact:** The "dormant state" pattern described in NEW-FLOW isn't truly event-driven as designed. The deferred publishing breaks the clean separation between delegation and execution.

### 2. Task Completion Synthesis Disabled ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Specification (NEW-FLOW.md lines 215-265):**
- When all tasks complete, system should synthesize responses
- Delegating agent gets reactivated with combined results

**Actual Implementation (`reply.ts` lines 243-265):**
- `synthesizeAndReactivate` function exists but doesn't actually reactivate
- Comments state "No need for synthetic events anymore" (line 259)
- Function just clears delegation state and returns `{ shouldReactivate: false }`

**Impact:** The multi-agent delegation pattern doesn't work as designed. Agents waiting for multiple sub-tasks won't properly receive synthesized results.

### 3. Claude Session Management Missing ‚ùå

**Specification (NEW-FLOW.md lines 589-655):**
- Claude sessions should be scoped to NDKTasks
- Each task gets its own isolated session
- Sessions cleared on task completion

**Actual Implementation:**
- No claude session management in `completionHandler.ts`
- Task handler (`task.ts`) reads claude-session tags but doesn't manage lifecycle
- Session scoping to tasks not implemented

**Impact:** No iterative refinement capability within task scope. Agents can't maintain context across implement-review-revise cycles.

### 4. Dead Code from Orchestrator System üßπ

**Files with orchestrator references (65 total):**
- Many test files still reference orchestrator concepts
- `src/claude/orchestrator.ts` - entire file should be deleted
- Comments referencing "orchestrator" throughout codebase
- `completionHandler.ts` line 20: "Required for orchestrator turn tracking" (obsolete)
- `completionHandler.ts` lines 84-87: Logic to find orchestrator agent still present

**Dead concepts still in code:**
- References to "orchestrator" in 65 files
- `workflow_narrative` and `routing_history` in test files only (2 files)
- OrchestratorTurnTracker already deleted ‚úÖ

### 5. Phase Management Implementation ‚úÖ

**Working correctly:**
- `switch_phase.ts` properly implements phase transitions
- PM has exclusive access to switch_phase tool
- Phase transitions are free-form as designed
- Phase context injection working

### 6. Agent Instructions Aligned ‚úÖ

**Correctly implemented:**
- PM instructions match NEW-FLOW delegation boundary principles
- Planner follows phase leadership pattern
- Executor implements claude_code orchestration correctly
- Clear separation of concerns between agents

### 7. Delegation Tool Partially Working ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Working:**
- Creates NDKTask events correctly
- Tracks pending delegations in agent state
- Resolves recipients properly

**Not Working:**
- Deferred publishing breaks event-driven pattern
- No proper task completion synthesis
- Missing task-to-conversation mapping in some flows

### 8. Event Handling Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Task handling (`task.ts`):**
- Creates conversation from NDKTask correctly
- Routes to appropriate agents
- But doesn't handle task completion events properly

**Reply handling (`reply.ts`):**
- `processTaskCompletion` updates task status
- But `synthesizeAndReactivate` doesn't actually reactivate agents
- Task completion events not triggering proper agent reactivation

## Inconsistencies Summary

1. **Deferred Publishing Pattern**: The delegate tool defers NDKTask publishing until after LLM metadata is available. This breaks the event-driven architecture where tasks should be immediately visible.

2. **No Task Synthesis**: The system updates task completion status but doesn't synthesize results or reactivate waiting agents.

3. **Missing Claude Sessions**: Task-scoped Claude sessions aren't implemented, breaking iterative refinement.

4. **Incomplete Cleanup**: 65 files still reference orchestrator concepts that should be removed.

5. **Task Completion Flow Broken**: The complete path from task completion ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí reactivation isn't working.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix NDKTask Publishing
- Publish NDKTask events immediately in delegate tool
- Add LLM metadata retrospectively if needed
- Restore true event-driven pattern

### Priority 2: Implement Task Synthesis
- Fix `synthesizeAndReactivate` to actually create synthetic events
- Ensure delegating agents receive combined results
- Test multi-agent delegation patterns

### Priority 3: Add Claude Session Management
- Implement session creation on first claude_code call within task
- Store session ID in agent state
- Clear session on task completion

### Priority 4: Complete Dead Code Removal
- Delete `src/claude/orchestrator.ts`
- Remove orchestrator references from comments
- Update test files to remove orchestrator concepts

### Priority 5: Fix Task Completion Flow
- Ensure task completions trigger agent reactivation
- Implement proper response synthesis
- Test end-to-end delegation chains

## Conclusion

The NEW-FLOW architecture is partially implemented but has critical gaps that prevent it from working as designed. The most significant issues are:

1. Deferred NDKTask publishing breaks the event-driven pattern
2. Task completion synthesis is disabled
3. Claude session management is missing
4. Significant dead code remains

These issues need to be addressed to achieve the clean, event-driven architecture described in NEW-FLOW.md. The system currently operates in a hybrid state between the old orchestrator model and the new PM-centric design.
