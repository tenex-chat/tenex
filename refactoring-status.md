# Event System Refactoring Status

## Completed âœ…

1. **Created AgentEventEncoder.ts**
   - Centralized encoding/decoding logic
   - Type-safe intent definitions
   - Clear semantic tagging rules
   - Comprehensive unit tests

2. **Created Consolidated AgentPublisher.ts**
   - Merged agent creation events from old AgentPublisher
   - High-level publisher using AgentEventEncoder
   - Methods renamed: complete(), delegate(), conversation()
   - Handles agent profiles, requests, responses, completions, delegations
   - All semantic tagging delegated to AgentEventEncoder

3. **Created AgentStreamer.ts**
   - Extracted streaming logic from AgentPublisher
   - Handles buffering, flushing, and finalization
   - Uses AgentPublisher for final event creation
   - Publishes kind:21111 streaming events

4. **Updated Tool Return Types**
   - `complete.ts` now returns `CompletionIntent`
   - `delegate.ts` now returns `DelegationIntent`
   - `delegate_phase.ts` now returns `DelegationIntent` with phase
   - Tools are now pure functions returning intents

5. **Refactored DelegationService.ts**
   - Removed event creation logic (createDelegationTasks method)
   - Now only provides recipient resolution utilities
   - Event creation moved to AgentPublisher

6. **Removed Obsolete Modules**
   - Deleted `EventTagger.ts` - logic moved to AgentEventEncoder
   - Deleted `completionHandler.ts` - no longer needed with intent system

7. **Integrated AgentStreamer**
   - Replaced StreamPublisher with AgentStreamer in ReasonActLoop
   - Updated ToolStreamHandler to use StreamHandle instead of StreamPublisher
   - Removed StreamPublisher class from NostrPublisher.ts
   - Removed streamPublisher from ExecutionContext type
   - Updated ToolPlugin to remove StreamPublisher references
   - Fixed test files that referenced StreamPublisher

## In Progress ðŸš§

None currently.

## TODO ðŸ“‹

1. **Update Tests**
   - RAL tests need updating for new intent-based flow
   - E2E tests need validation of new event structure
   - Tool tests should verify intent returns
   - Remove tests for deleted modules (EventTagger, completionHandler)

## Summary

The core event system refactoring is now complete:

1. **Centralized Event Creation**: All agent event creation now flows through `AgentEventEncoder` and `AgentPublisher`
2. **Intent-Based Tools**: Tools return simple intent objects instead of creating events
3. **Clean Separation**: Event creation logic removed from tools and services
4. **RAL Integration**: ReasonActLoop detects and publishes terminal intents

The main architectural goals have been achieved. Remaining work involves deciding on the streaming architecture and updating tests.
