# Proper Cleanup Complete

## What We Actually Fixed

### The Problem
- Fragments had `if (isOrchestrator)` checks scattered throughout
- Multiple redundant fragments saying the same things
- Logic for choosing what to show was inside fragments instead of at the builder level

### The Solution

Created **properly separated fragments with NO conditionals**:

#### For Specialists:
- `specialist-identity.ts` - Identity, role, and guidelines for specialists
- `specialist-tools.ts` - All tools (agent + MCP) for specialists  
- `specialist-reasoning.ts` - Thinking tag format for specialists

#### For Orchestrators:
- `orchestrator-identity.ts` - Minimal identity for orchestrators
- `orchestrator-reasoning.ts` - Routing analysis format for orchestrators
- `orchestrator-routing.ts` - (already existed) Routing instructions

#### The Key Change in systemPromptBuilder.ts:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fragments had conditionals inside
systemPromptBuilder.add("agent-identity", { agent, ... });
// Fragment would check: if (isOrchestrator) { ... } else { ... }

// AFTER: Builder chooses the right fragment
if (agent.isOrchestrator) {
    systemPromptBuilder.add("orchestrator-identity", { ... });
} else {
    systemPromptBuilder.add("specialist-identity", { ... });
}
```

### What's Better Now

1. **No more conditionals in fragments** - Each fragment does ONE thing
2. **Clear separation** - Specialist fragments vs Orchestrator fragments vs Shared fragments
3. **Logic at the right level** - The builder decides what to include, not the fragments
4. **Easier to maintain** - Want to change specialist behavior? Edit specialist fragments. Want to change orchestrator behavior? Edit orchestrator fragments.

### What We Deleted
All the redundant fragments that were consolidated into the specialist fragments.

### Build Status
