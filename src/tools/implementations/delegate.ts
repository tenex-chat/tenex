/**
 * Delegate tool - enables agents to communicate with each other via kind:1111 conversation events
 *
 * This tool allows an agent to delegate a request or question to one or more agents by:
 * 1. Resolving each recipient (agent slug or pubkey) to a pubkey
 * 2. Publishing a kind:1111 conversation event for each recipient with p-tag assignment
 * 3. Setting up delegation state so the agent waits for all responses
 *
 * Recipients can be:
 * - A single recipient or array of recipients
 * - Agent slugs (e.g., "architect", "planner") - resolved from project agents
 * - Agent names (e.g., "Architect", "Planner") - resolved from project agents
 * - Npubs (e.g., "npub1...") - decoded to hex pubkeys
 * - Hex pubkeys (64 characters) - used directly
 *
 * If any recipient cannot be resolved, the tool fails with an error.
 *
 * When delegating to multiple recipients, the agent will wait for all responses
 * before continuing. The agent should NOT complete after delegating.
 *
 * Each delegation creates a kind:1111 conversation event (following NIP-22) that:
 * - Is addressed to a specific agent via p-tag
 * - Maintains conversation threading via E/e tags
 * - Enables natural agent-to-agent communication
 * - Supports parallel execution when delegating to multiple agents

Use this to communicate with other agents by delegating tasks or questions.
IMPORTANT: recipients must ALWAYS be an array, even for a single recipient.
IMPORTANT: NEVER Delegate to yourself.

Examples:
- delegate(["architect"], "Design a database schema for user authentication")
- delegate(["architect", "planner"], "Review and plan the new feature implementation")
- delegate(["npub1abc..."], "Review this implementation for security issues")
- delegate(["executor", "npub1xyz..."], "Implement and test this feature")

The delegate() tool will wait for all responses and return them to you.
You can then process the responses and continue with your task.`,
