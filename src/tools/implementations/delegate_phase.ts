/**
 * Delegate Phase tool - enables the Project Manager to atomically switch phases and delegate work
 *
 * This tool combines phase switching with task delegation, ensuring the PM always:
 * 1. Switches to the appropriate phase for the work being done
 * 2. Provides custom phase instructions to guide agent behavior
 * 3. Delegates the task to the appropriate specialist agent(s)
 * 4. Sets up proper event-driven callbacks for task completion
 *
 * Phase can be:
 * - Standard phases: CHAT, BRAINSTORM, PLAN, EXECUTE, VERIFICATION, CHORES, REFLECTION
 * - Custom phases: Any string that represents a project-specific phase
 *
 * Phase Instructions:
 * - Detailed instructions that define what should be accomplished in this phase
 * - These instructions override standard phase definitions for custom phases
 * - Agents receive these instructions as part of their execution context
 *
 * The fullRequest serves dual purpose:
 * - Becomes the phase transition reason (context for all agents)
 * - Is the actual task delegated to the specified recipients
 *
 * Recipient can be:
 * - Agent slug (e.g., "architect", "planner") - resolved from project agents
 * - Agent name (e.g., "Architect", "Planner") - resolved from project agents
 * - Npub (e.g., "npub1...") - decoded to hex pubkey
 * - Hex pubkey (64 characters) - used directly
 *
 * If recipient cannot be resolved, the tool fails with an error.
 *
 * The agent should NOT complete after using delegate_phase.
