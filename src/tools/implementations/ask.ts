/**
 * Ask tool - enables agents to ask questions to the project manager or human user
 *
 * This tool allows an agent to escalate a question and pause execution until receiving a response.
 * It uses the delegation service backend to handle the waiting mechanism, ensuring consistent
 * behavior with other delegation tools.
 *
 * Question Types:
 * - Open-ended: When suggestions is empty or not provided
 * - Yes/No: When suggestions is ['Yes', 'No']
 * - Multiple choice: Any custom list of string suggestions
 *
 * The tool publishes a special Nostr event that includes:
 * - The question as the event content
 * - Each suggestion as a separate ['suggestion', '...'] tag
 * - Proper conversation threading via E/e tags
 *
 * The agent will wait for a response before continuing execution.
 * This is particularly useful when:
 * - The agent needs clarification on requirements
 * - Multiple valid approaches exist and user preference is needed
 * - Critical decisions require human approval
 * - The agent encounters ambiguous instructions
