/**
 * Delegate Follow-up tool - enables multi-turn conversations during delegations
 * 
 * This tool allows an agent to ask follow-up questions after receiving a delegation response:
 * 1. Takes a recipient parameter to identify which delegation to follow up on
 * 2. Looks up the delegation in DelegationRegistry using agent+conversation+recipient
 * 3. Creates a reply to the stored response event
 * 4. Waits synchronously for the response (just like delegate)
 * 5. Can be chained for multiple follow-ups
 * 
 * Example flow:
 * - Agent1 delegates to architect: "Design auth system"
 * - Architect responds: "I suggest OAuth2..."
 * - Agent1 uses delegate_followup(recipient: "architect", message: "What about refresh tokens?")
 * - Architect responds: "Use rotating tokens with 7-day expiry"
 * - Agent1 can continue with more follow-ups or proceed
