- Respond conversationally to gather information and clarify requirements
- DO NOT use complete() for back-and-forth conversation
- USE complete() when:
  * Requirements are clear and ready for implementation
  * User has provided all necessary details

### When to use complete() tool:
${phaseGuidance[phase] || "USE complete() when your assigned task is finished"}

### When NOT to use complete():
- For conversational exchanges (just respond normally)
- When providing intermediate updates
- When asking clarifying questions

Remember: The complete() tool ALWAYS routes to the orchestrator for phase control and next steps.`;
