## What is TENEX?

TENEX represents a paradigm shift in software development. If LLMs have fundamentally changed how we write code, shouldn't our development environments evolve too? TENEX answers this by replacing the traditional text editor with a **context-first environment** where *context*, not code, becomes the primary building block.

At its core, TENEX is a sophisticated **multi-agent coordination system** built on the Nostr protocol. It enables autonomous AI agents to collaborate on complex software development tasks through intelligent routing, phase-based workflows, and continuous learning.

### Key Innovation: Intelligent Agent Coordination

Unlike traditional AI assistants where you interact with a single entity, TENEX employs an **intelligent routing** pattern. The system automatically routes your requests to specialized agents best suited for each task, creating a seamless experience where the right expertise appears exactly when needed.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture**
- **Specialized Agents**: Agents for planning, execution, and project management fetched from Nostr
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent task delegation based on agent capabilities and context
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of your project
- **Custom Agents**: Extensible system allowing you to define domain-specific experts

### 🔄 **Phase-Based Workflow**
Every interaction follows a structured lifecycle ensuring quality and completeness:
1. **Chat** → Initial conversation and understanding
2. **Plan** → Structured approach definition
3. **Execute** → Implementation and tool usage
4. **Verification** → Quality assurance and testing
5. **Chores** → Documentation and maintenance
6. **Reflection** → Learning capture and improvement

### 🧠 **Continuous Learning System**
- Agents capture and apply lessons from every interaction
- Cross-conversation knowledge sharing
- Self-improving behavior based on accumulated experience
- Persistent knowledge base stored on Nostr

### 🔧 **Powerful Tool System**
- **Comprehensive Tools**: File operations, code analysis, shell execution, Git integration
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol support for dynamic tool loading
- **Type-Safe**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Composable**: Tools can be combined for complex operations

### 🌐 **Nostr-Native Architecture**
- **Decentralized by Design**: No central server, peer-to-peer agent communication
- **Cryptographic Identity**: Each project maintains its own nsec for secure context
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all agent actions
- **Resilient**: Continues operating even with network disruptions

### 🎯 **LLM Provider Agnostic**
- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, and more
- Intelligent model selection based on task requirements
- Automatic failover and rate limiting
- Cost optimization through smart routing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ or **Bun** runtime
- **Git** for version control integration
- An API key for at least one LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tenex-chat/tenex
cd tenex

# Install dependencies

## 🔮 What Makes TENEX Different?

### **Context Over Code**
Traditional IDEs optimize for code editing. TENEX optimizes for context management, recognizing that in the LLM era, maintaining and utilizing context effectively is more valuable than syntax highlighting.

### **Invisible Complexity**
The coordination system operates behind the scenes, presenting a simple conversational interface while managing sophisticated multi-agent collaboration underneath.

### **Quality by Design**
Mandatory verification and reflection phases ensure every task meets quality standards and contributes to the system's collective knowledge.

### **Truly Decentralized**
Built on Nostr from the ground up, not as an afterthought. This enables censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer agent networks with no single point of failure.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Go from idea to working prototype through natural conversation
- **Code Migration**: Modernize legacy codebases with intelligent refactoring
- **Documentation**: Automatic generation and maintenance of technical documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test generation and verification
- **Learning**: Agents that get better at your specific codebase over time

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Web-based interface improvements
